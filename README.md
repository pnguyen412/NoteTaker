# NoteTaker

## Description
- The main objective of this challenge was to create a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that scores high scours so that the user, a bootcamp student can gauge their progress with their peers.
- In addition to the above, we were tasked with ensuring that the quiz starts when the start quiz button is pressed, which then presents the user with a question and corresponding choices. Should the user get an incorrect answer, the timer would be reduced by an additional 10 seconds. 
- I also used bootstrap in lieu of a traditional style.css along with the usage of methods to complete this challenge .
- I learned how to combine previous knowledge with the new knowledge such as traversing DOM with JS, creating append, timer intervals and local storage to help me create this application.
